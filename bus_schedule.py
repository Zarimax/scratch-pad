# from http://gtfs.ovapi.nl/README:
# 1) Identify in the User-Agent header who you are, this helps us to contact you. This 
# ultimately allows us to offer this service without registration and contact you in 
# case of wrong doing.
# 2) Implement HTTP Headers such as If-Modified-Since and/or If-None-Match if your 
# implementation thinks we offer updates more frequently than once a minute, and you 
# want to implement the Niquist-frequency.
# 3) We rarely update our schedules more than daily and our new operational day starts 
# at 03AM UTC. We take special measurements to maximize the stability of trip_ids 
# between schedules to assure a grace period.

# METADATA PROCESSING
# Once per day at some random interval between 2am and 4am:
# get metadata from http://gtfs.ovapi.nl/nl/gtfs-nl.zip (if modified since last run)
# unzip and load into sqllite

# - Take these parameters:
#    begin_stop_name: "Haarlem, Emmaplein"
#    end_stop_name: "Haarlem, Centrum/Houtplein"
# - translate stop names into stop_id lists with [stops.txt]
# - get all trip_id from [stop_times.txt] where a begin.stop_id is followed by an end.stop_id (handle none)

# REAL-TIME PROCESSING
# Once per minute during wake hours
# get metadata from http://gtfs.ovapi.nl/nl/vehiclePositions.pb (if modified since last run)
# - extract data for the target trip_id (handle none)
# - filter to where current_stop_sequence <= stop_sequence containing begin.stop_id
# - estimate bus arrival time = 
#     begin.stop_id.arrival_time - 
#     timestamp +
#     difference between timestamp and current time +
#     off_schedule_minutes

# TODO - algorithm for calculating off_schedule_minutes, (both early and late)
#   if current_stop_sequence.arrival_time >= timestamp >= previous_stop_sequence.departure_time
#      off_schedule_minutes = 0  # bus is ontime
#   else
#      find the most recent departure time in the past where timestamp > departure time
#      calculate the difference between current_stop_sequence.arrival_time
